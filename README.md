# Penguin: AI Chatbot

An assistant interface for GNOME that works by using a personal Open Router LLM API. For more information on what Open Router is, go [here](https://openrouter.ai/)

# Getting the Open Router API

1. Sign up in [Open Router's website](https://accounts.openrouter.ai/sign-up)

2. Go to [Your Open Router keys](https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys)

3. Click on the 'Create Key' button

4. Add any name you want to the key. I recommend you don't bother with credit limits if you are using the default LLM for the extension or any free model

5. Click on the 'Create' button

6. Copy your new key

7. Go back to the extension settings window and paste your key. Make sure to first delete the default 'Input your key here' text

That's it. You can use the extension now. You don't need to change the default LLM model. But if you do want to, you can go to the list of LLMs [here](https://openrouter.ai/docs/models) and make sure to copy only the model ID. An example of a free model ID is [mattshumer/reflection-70b:free](#). Note the :free at the end.
